# acme-ohmyzsh Puppet Module

This is the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) module. It installs oh-my-zsh for a user and changes their shell to zsh. It also can configure themes and plugins for users.

oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. See [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for more details.

This module is called ohmyzsh as Puppet does not support hyphens in module names.
